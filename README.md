## EDA
Trend of average temperature is increasing with time.The middle of the year experiences the hottest of average temperature.There is a huge spike at the end of every month
### Finding a relatio between the calculated lattitudes, longitudes, distance from the poles with average temperature
Very less variance of average temperature between 8000 to 12000 km 
Very less variance of average temperature between -15 to +15
### These 4 Cities have multiple entries as there are two different cities with the same name as their states are different :
Charleston :  ['South Carolina' 'West Virginia'],
Columbus :    ['Georgia' 'Ohio'],
Portland :    ['Maine' 'Oregon'],
Springfield:  ['Illinois' 'Missouri'].
